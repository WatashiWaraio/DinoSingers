# DinoSingers 🎤🦖

Hey there! 👋 Today, we're diving into a fun project where we’ll manage  singers and their top-selling albums! 🦕🎶

## Project Overview
We'll create a class called ListaCantantesFamosos, which will hold an ArrayList of cantanteFamoso objects. 
Each cantanteFamoso will have two attributes: nombre (String) and discoconmasVentas (String). We'll also implement methods to get and set these attributes.

# Steps to Implement 📝

Delete singers from the list.
Modify the name of a singer.
Generate a list of singers sorted by the number of albums sold from highest to lowest.
